What is Jasper Report?
JasperReports is an open-source Java-based reporting tool that allows developers to generate dynamic reports from various data sources.

It provides a flexible and powerfull framework for designing, generating, and delivering reports in multiple formats such as PDF, HTML, CSV, and more

JasperReports uses an XML-based report template format called JRXML(JasperReports XML), which defines the structure and layout of the report.

The template can be created using a visual report designer tool, such as jaspersoft studio or IReport, or directly in XML format.

What is JasperSoft Studio?
Jaspersoft studio is a powerful and feature-rich visual report designer tool for JasperReports.

It is an open-source desktop application that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for designing, editin, and previewing reports created using the jasperReports library.

What is Report?
A report is a meaningful, well-defined, and summarized presentation of information.
Reports represent usual messy data into charts, graphs, and other forms of graphical representations.

JRXML and JASPER file
Jasper Report life cycle

JRXML (JasperReports XML)

JRXML (JasperReports XML) and Jasper files are components of the jasperReports library
JRXML is an XML-based file format used to define the structure and layout of a report in JasperReports.
It serves as a template or blueprint for generating reports.
JRXML files are human-readable and can be edited using text editor or specialized report design tools.
They contain report elements such as text fields , images, charts and formatting instructions
JRXXML files define the data sources, query statements, and parameters required for generating the report

JASPER file

Jasper files are compiled versions of JRXML files with extension.jasper
Jasper files are binary files and cannot be easily edited by developers.
They encapsulate the design, structure, and data required to produce a report.
Jasper files can be executed to generate reports in various formats, such as PDF, HTML, Excel, etc.
They are optimized for performance and can be distributed and executed independently of the JasperRepots library.

Jasper Report Life Cycle

Design Phase => Create JRXML file and design it in Jaspersoft Studio
Compile Phase => Compile JRXML to jasper file
Execution Phase => Fill the jasper template with Data to generate jasper print file(*.jrprint)
Export Phase => Export the report to any desired format.
